                    <h4>What is Git?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Git is an open-source distributed version control system which provides
                        a free way to manage projects of any size, allowing multiple individuals
                        to collaborate while maintainng full change history.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Who started Git?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Git was created initially by Linus Torvalds as a means of managing the
                        development of Linux distrobutions, and has been in the hands of 
                        Junio Hamano since version 1.0.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <h4>What is Hub?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Hub, in this context, is a command-line tool which encompasses and extends
                        the base Git commands specifically to increase ease of use with GitHub.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Describe "Repository" and its role:</h4>
                    <p>
                        A Git Repository is essentially an ordered collection of commit statements.
                        A repository allows an individual to clone a project by replaying those
                        commit statements.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Thoughts about GitHub:</h4>
                    <p>
                        GitHub is an excellent way to collaborate with other individuals on a
                        shared project without the overhead of setting up your own custom Git
                        environment. Additionally, GitHub provides a simple means of distribution
                        and code review.
